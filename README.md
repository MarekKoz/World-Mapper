## World Mapper

### Overview

Interactive map built with Python, Leaflet.js, and Folium. 

Using population data from JSON file and volcano data from CSV file, the map colors in countries based on population. Green countries have a population of less than 15 Mil, orange countries have a population of 15 Mil to 35 Mil, red countries are 35 Mil +. 

Volcano leaflets are colorcoded to represent elevation. Leaflets that are green represent volcanoes less than 1000 m. Orange leaflets represent volcanoes between 1000 and 3000 m. Red leaflets represent 3000+ m volcanoes. When a leaflet is opened, user can click on name of volcano to open a Google Search for that volcano. 

My High School and University are displayed with year founded. When a leaflet is opened, user can click on name of school to open a Google Search for that school.

User is able to turn on/off the High School layer, University Layer, Volcano Layer, and Population Layer.
